    Today, I woke up late again, which made me feel a bit low in self-esteem. 
I realized I should strictly adjust my sleeping schedule.
    By the way, the problems on LeetCode really captured my attention, 
since they are more challenging for me. Because of that, they took more time 
than originally planned and caused my schedule to collapse.
    However, I will try not to overload my to-do list this week and just let things flow. 
If I can get through this week by consistently following the plan, 
I believe it will naturally become a habit.
    Finally, I will review calculus tomorrow. TFR!!!

    Today was quite similar to the previous days. I had a quiz on data structures & algorithms 
in class again, and I felt more prepared than last time because I reviewed with AI-generated questions.
    However, I missed reading calculus again. So tomorrow, I will dedicate time to studying 
calculus instead of data structures, though I still need to solve problems on LeetCode as well.
    Finally, I have a sore throat because I reviewed several subjects—such as Python 
and data structures & algorithms—by speaking with AI. TFR!!!
