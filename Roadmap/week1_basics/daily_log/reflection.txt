Today, I learned about basic c++ programming such as what c++ come form, elements in program, 
steps from creating to executing code, data types and limits. By the way, Today is the first day
of planning to become an AI engineer. I'm very excited to follow my schedule strictly, but I'm
pretty worried in my plan that is the right or good way to be an AI engineer? However, I believe
that the plan is appropriate to me in the limit time. In the next reflection, I will talk about
knowledge that I learned. TFR!!!

Today, I learned and review about c++ programming such as what is c++, all of data types, how to 
allocate/deallocate memory with new/delete, file object, some of useful instruction, and process
of build c++ programming. To be honest, I also should learn about calculus, but I stayed up very late
at last night. However, I don't waste any time for this obstacle things and I take a lot of time 
for reviewing c++ for quiz in tomorrow. I'm very anxiety for it, although I know that no one gonna be perfect.
Yeah, it is a human being and I'm a human, human has mistake. Let's move it on and follow a plan.
TFR Have fun !!!
