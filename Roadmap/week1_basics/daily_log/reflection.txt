Today, I learned about basic c++ programming such as what c++ come form, elements in program, 
steps from creating to executing code, data types and limits. By the way, Today is the first day
of planning to become an AI engineer. I'm very excited to follow my schedule strictly, but I'm
pretty worried in my plan that is the right or good way to be an AI engineer? However, I believe
that the plan is appropriate to me in the limit time. In the next reflection, I will talk about
knowledge that I learned. TFR!!!
